         <h2 class="con">Group IPBA Conclusion</h2>
         <p class="ipba">
            Accomplishing this Group task was a rollercoaster to say the least, a lot of improvements made and changed. It was also difficult because school events weâ€™re also happening recently, we had a hard time juggling our school works for it not to be mixed with event responsibilities. Overall I think we did a great job finishing this IPBA, As the group leader I am proud of us and for our team effort. <br>
            
            <br> We did what we could throughout the making of the IPBA, we were able to collect 54 respondents both apec students and outsiders. Thankfully we had a lot of friends that were very cooperative with answering the Usability Test, we were a bit behind in collecting respondents but Thank God that we reached our target number.
