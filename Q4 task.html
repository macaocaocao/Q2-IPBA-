            <h2 class="Rev">Our Research on our typhoon "Glenda"</h2>
            <section class="Glenda">
                <p>
                    Typhoon Glenda, known internationally as Typhoon Rammasun, was a significant tropical cyclone that affected the Philippines, South China, and Vietnam in July 2014. It was formed on July 9, 2014, and dissipated on July 20, 2014. It reached Category 5 super typhoon status, with 1-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and lowest pressure of 918 hPa (27.11 inHg). The estimated rainfall amount during Typhoon Glenda ranged from 7.5 to 20 millimeters per hour, which is considered moderate to intense precipitation within the 500 km diameter of the typhoon.<br>

                    <br> How was the community affected by the typhoon? <br>
                   <br> Typhoon Glenda had a profound impact on the communities it hit. It caused 225 fatalities, 1.6 million people affected, 500,000 evacuated, 40 deaths, 26,000 homes destroyed, and 12 million people displaced in the Philippines, with 500,000 seeking refuge in evacuation centers. Typhoon Glenda caused $8.08 billion in damage to the Philippines, affecting agriculture and fisheries. It disrupted livelihoods, damaged crops, and disrupted food supply chains. Compared to Super Typhoon Yolanda, Glenda was less catastrophic due to pre-emptive evacuation measures. Community resilience, preparedness, and support are crucial for recovery and rebuilding.
