        <h3 class="loger"><b>Let's go through all the Brainstorming Techniques!</b></h3>
        <section class="sec">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>First : Mind Mapping</b>
            <ol class="a">
                <li>Exploration: Initiated the process by creating a mind map to visually organize key themes related to historical gender issues. Identified categories such as suffrage, violence, discrimination, health, education, and stereotypes.</li>
             <li>Connections: Visualized the interconnectedness of these themes, recognizing their historical significance and relevance to contemporary global and Philippine contexts.</li></ol><br> 
    &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Second: Free Association</b>
         <ol class="b">
            <li>Divergent Thinking: Allowed for free association to generate a diverse list of historical gender problems. Jotted down ideas without immediate judgment to ensure inclusivity of various issues.</li>
            <li>Expansive Exploration: Encouraged a wide range of considerations, from suffrage movements to reproductive rights, to capture the complexity of gender issues over time.</li></ol><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Third: Nominal Group Technique</b>
         <ol class="c">
            <li>Individual Idea Generation: Considered various historical gender problems, drawing from both global and Philippine contexts. Evaluated the importance of suffrage, violence, discrimination, and health as central themes.</li>
            <li>Structured Integration: Organized the generated ideas in a structured and coherent manner, ensuring a logical flow in the response. This technique allowed for a collective integration of knowledge and perspectives.</li></ol><br>
